# PYTHON INTRODUCTION

## PYTHON DATA TYPES
A data type is an attribute associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interpret its value. Python Data Types are used to define the type of a variable. It defines what type of data we are going to store in a variable. The data stored in memory can be of many types.
- Number
  In Python, the "number type" refers to the data types used to represent numeric values. There are several numeric data types in Python:
  - Integer (int): Represents whole numbers without any decimal point. For example, 5, -10, 100, etc.
  - Floating-point (float): Represents numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form. For example, 3.14, -0.001, 2.71828, etc.
  - Complex: Represents complex numbers with real and imaginary parts. It's represented as a + bj, where a and b are floats and j is the imaginary unit (sqrt(-1)). For example, 2 + 3j, -1 - 2j, etc.
- String
  In Python, the string data type (str) is used to represent textual data. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed within either single quotes (') or double quotes ("). Strings can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace characters. They support various operations and methods for manipulation and formatting. For example:
  - 
- Boolean
  
- List
- Slicing
- Tuple
- Set
- Dictionary
